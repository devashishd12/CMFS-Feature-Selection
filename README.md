# iCMFS + IGFSS Algorithm for feature selection

This is a python implementation of the iCMFS + IGFSS (using correlation coefficient) algorithm for feature selection (papers included in the repository). Currently the implementation has been completed on a toy dataset and the 20NG dataset.

See `report.pdf` for an explanation and the results of our experimentation.
